🗺️ ROADMAP: Writing Graph Optimizations in C++ from Basics (Compiler Role)
🔰 PHASE 1: Master C++ (Weeks 1–2)

Before doing any compiler-related work, you need solid C++ foundations.

✅ Topics:

Pointers & references

Classes, inheritance, virtual functions

Templates & STL

RAII & Smart pointers

Manual memory management (new/delete)

Lambda functions

📚 Resources:

Book: C++ Primer by Lippman

Online: cppreference.com

Practice: Write small tools or parsers

📊 PHASE 2: Learn Graph Theory & Algorithms (Weeks 3–5)

This is essential — most compiler optimizations involve graph traversal.

✅ Topics:

Graph representations: adjacency list, matrix

DFS/BFS

Topological Sort

SCC (Tarjan’s or Kosaraju’s)

Dominator Trees (used in CFG)

Dataflow Analysis

Control Flow Graphs (CFG)

Interference Graphs (for register allocation)

📚 Resources:

Book: Algorithm Design Manual – Steven Skiena

Course: CS 161 (Stanford Algorithms)

Visuals: https://visualgo.net

⚙️ PHASE 3: Learn Compiler Basics (Weeks 6–9)

Focus on how compilers work and how optimizations are structured.

✅ Topics:

Lexical analysis (tokenizing)

Parsing (AST construction)

IR (Intermediate Representation)

SSA form (Static Single Assignment)

Control Flow Graphs (CFG)

Register allocation (graph coloring)

Loop optimizations

📚 Resources:

Book: Modern Compiler Implementation in C – Appel

Free Book: Engineering a Compiler – Keith Cooper

MIT 6.035 Compiler Course (YouTube + lecture notes)

🧠 PHASE 4: Work with LLVM (Weeks 10–15)

LLVM is the industry standard for writing compiler optimizations. You’ll write graph-based passes here.

✅ Goals:

Build & compile LLVM

Understand how to write a simple LLVM pass

Learn IR (LLVM Intermediate Representation)

Traverse and modify Control Flow Graphs (CFGs)

Use LLVM’s DominatorTree, LoopInfo, Dataflow utilities

📚 Resources:

LLVM Official Tutorial

LLVM Pass Development Tutorial (by Eli Bendersky)

Book: LLVM Essentials

Explore tools like opt, clang, and llc

🧪 Project Ideas:

Dead code elimination

Constant folding

Loop invariant code motion

Value range propagation

Custom optimization pass for IR

🧮 PHASE 5: Deep Dive into Graph-Based Optimizations (Weeks 16–20)
✅ Topics:

Dataflow Analysis (live variable analysis, reaching definitions)

Register Allocation using Graph Coloring

Control Flow Graph Optimizations

Loop optimizations (unrolling, fusion)

SSA and Phi node resolution

📚 Deep Resources:

Advanced Compiler Design and Implementation – Steven Muchnick

Compiler Explorer (godbolt.org) – See how C++ compiles at different levels

🧪 PHASE 6: Projects & Practice (Weeks 21–24)

This is key for interviews and practical understanding.

✅ Project Ideas:

Write your own mini compiler (frontend + backend)

Implement register allocation using graph coloring

Write LLVM passes for:

Dead code elimination

CFG simplification

Loop strength reduction

💡 Advanced:

Work on an open-source compiler project (LLVM, GCC, Cranelift)

Contribute to LLVM bug fixes or codegen passes

📄 PHASE 7: Interview Prep (Ongoing)
✅ Topics:

C++ systems questions

Compiler internals

Memory layout

Common optimizations

LeetCode-style coding for graph problems

Behavioral questions (explain a system you optimized, etc.)

📚 Interview Resources:

GitHub: nlohmann/awesome-compilers

Leetcode tag: Graph

Open Source: Contribute to LLVM’s open bug list
